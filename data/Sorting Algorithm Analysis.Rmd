## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
data <- read.csv("sortingData.csv") 
groupedData <- data %>% group_by(Algorithm) %>% summarize(Duration)
```
```{r}
reads <- ggplot(data = data, mapping = aes(x = Vector.Size, y = Reads, color = Algorithm)) + geom_point(position = "dodge2") + labs(x = "Vector Size", y = "Reads", title = "Number of Reads for Each Sorting Algorithm", color = NULL) + facet_wrap(vars(Algorithm)) + theme(legend.position = "none") + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(200,400,600,800,1000))
reads

writes <- ggplot(data = data, mapping = aes(x = Vector.Size, y = Writes, color = Algorithm)) + geom_point(position = "dodge2") + labs(x = "Vector Size", y = "Writes", title = "Number of Writes for Each Sorting Algorithm", color = NULL) + facet_wrap(vars(Algorithm)) + theme(legend.position = "none") + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(200,400,600,800,1000))
writes
```


```{r}
duration <- ggplot(data = data, mapping = aes(x = Vector.Size, y = Duration, color = Algorithm)) + geom_point(position = "dodge2") + labs(x = "Vector Size", y = "Time (milliseconds)", title = "Duration of Each Sorting Algorithm", color = NULL) + facet_wrap(vars(Algorithm)) + theme(legend.position = "none") + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(200,400,600,800,1000))
duration
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
